# G-NAV web client
This is the source code of the G-NAV web client WebAssembly module that runs on the internet browsers. To compile this project you need AdaWebPack installed in a subdirectory named "/adawebpack".

> [!TIP]
> To make your life easier you can just use the released version of AdaWebPack. You will need LLVM 14.0 for this.
> Here you will find a modified version of the `adawebpack.mjs` file, which is temporarily necessary to include extra features and overcome issues.
