# G-NAV web client data bank
This folder must contain the precompiled data required by the system:

- aircraft.bin
- airspaces.bin
- reference.bin
- layers.bin
- terrain_1.bin
- terrain_2.bin
- terrain_3.bin
- terrain_4.bin

This data is obtained by processing raw data with the gnav_crunch data compilation tool. Take a look at the README file on the ./source folder for more information.
